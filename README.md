# maxsbirthday

This is a very simple PWA demo, with a picture and a bit of JavaScript.

Once upon a time, JSOxford organised a meetup that happened to be on Max's birthday. On the Slack channel Max said this:

I wasn't going to do it. Then I did it, but it took me quite a bit longer than I thought it would.

Anyway, I made this thing. The idea is you can go to that site, pin it to your homescreen, and even if you're offline (on Android), it will tell you if it's Max's birthday. You can have it pinned on iOS but it only works when you're online.
